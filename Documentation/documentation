conda install -c tpaviot -c conda-forge ifcopenshell==0.6.0.a0f79cc

1) Install conda enviorment

	$ cd ~/Downloads
	$ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py39_4.10.3-Linux-x86_64.sh
	$ chmod +x Miniconda3-py39_4.10.3-Linux-x86_64.sh
	$ ./Miniconda3-py39_4.10.3-Linux-x86_64.sh
	# I installed miniconda3 in /home/alon/LocalInstalls

2) Install related packages
	See insatllingVenvs folder
	summary:
		pythonocc-core version 7.4.0 works, but is old and missing functionality I require
		pythonocc-core verison 7.4.1 works, and I currently have what I need for the immediate future
		python-core version 7.5.1 doesnt work, has "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" issues in ifcopenshell
			edit: it would seem it might work in ubuntu 20.04: https://github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc-core/issues/1055

	things I learnt:
		I can install versions of modules directly from git using pip IF they have a setup.py
		(did this for pythonocc-utils)

	relevant urls:
		https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?t=37460
		https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell/issues/1327, pythonocc 7.5.1 works well with ifcopenshell 0.7 (comment by aothms)
		https://github.com/cztomczak/cefpython/issues/349, wxpython has a bug in it. DONT DO: $ conda install -c conda-forge wxpython ()


3) create and play with ref-gits/pythonocc-demos
	$ cd ref-gits	
	$ git clone https://github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc-demos
	$ cd pythonocc-documentation
	$ cd examples
	$ python core_helloworld.py
	->>> ImportError: No compliant GUI library could be imported.
	
	$ conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib # ("$ conda install -c conda-forge pyqt" might be sufficent)
	$ python core_helloworld.py
	->>> NICE !! cube on screen

4) create and play with documentation ref-gits/pythonocc-documentation #NOTE! This seems to be documentation to 7.4
	$ cd ref-gits
	$ git clone https://github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc-documentation
	$ cd pythonocc-documentation
	$ cd getting_started
	$ make html
		'''
		Makefile:12: *** The 'sphinx-build' command was not found. Make sure you have Sphinx installed, then set the SPHINXBUILD 			environment variable to point to the full path of the 'sphinx-build' executable. Alternatively you can add the directory 			with the executable to your PATH. If you don't have Sphinx installed, grab it from http://sphinx-doc.org/.  Stop.
		'''
		$ conda install -c anaconda sphinx
		$ conda install -c conda-forge sphinx_rtd_theme
		$ make html (try again)

	TADA: html documentation now available "Build finished. The HTML pages are in _build/html."

	$ cd ..
	$ cd api_doc
	$ sphinx-apidoc $HOME$/LocalInstalls/miniconda3/envs/pyoccenv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/OCC --separate -o api_doc
	# your OCC package path might be different
	$ make html

5)  create and play with ref-gits/ifcopenshell-notebooks
	$ ref-gits
	$ git clone https://github.com/jakob-beetz/ifcopenshell-notebooks
	# run 05_hello_viewer.ipynb

6) I checked that the renderer is working as I want it:
	ran /ref-gits/pythonocc-demos/ifc_display_basic_file.ipynb

7) Start learning: I created "01_crashCourse.ipynb"
	Using: https://wiki.osarch.org/index.php?title=IfcOpenShell_code_examples#Crash_course
	
	What did I learn:	
		a) read .ifc files 
		b) elements have guid or global unique identifier
		c) elements have structred data that is ordered, but can be accessed with get/set
		d) elements can reference or be references by other elements (example: booleanic operations). This graph can be accessed
		e) we can also write .ifc files
		f) just a little of how to extract geomtrey from elements
	
	problems: ifc.remove(wall) is not working
	

8) Geomtrey Manipulation! I Created "02_ConstructNewGeomtrey.ipynb"
	 with https://academy.ifcopenshell.org/posts/using-ifcopenshell-and-pythonocc-to-construct-new-geometry/
	 there is also this: https://www.linuxtut.com/en/dced9fc3d8869e88ce6c/

	note: I got the IFC models from https://github.com/aothms/IfcOpenHouse

	What did I learn:
		a) import and display geomtrey
		b) obtain normal direction of faces that belong to a shape
		c) filter out or paint faces depending on their normal direction

9) Image Capturing! I created "03_ImageCapture.ipynb"
	references: 
		/pythonocc-demos/examples/core_visualization_camera_2
		/pythonocc-demos/examples/core_visualization_camera

	It has two files, one for env pyoccenv740 and one for pyoccenv741.
	pyoccenv740 is missing functionality which I need


10) Camera projection matrix is in opengl format, not the one I like.. here's some info:
